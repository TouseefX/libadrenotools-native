Tested with Roblox with Turniup MTR 3.2.0 AXxx S20 Ultra 5G (Vulkan)

unlike the note verison this one was at maximum and has better performance but it got so hot the charging stopped working

Tested with Roblox with Turniup MrPurple T24 AXxx S20 Ultra 5G (And Note) (Vulkan)

### FAQ

#### Is there an example project?

There is a simple bare-bones project [AdrenoToolsTest](https://github.com/darksylinc/AdrenoToolsTest) demonstrating how to get libadrenotools working.

#### How do I use this to update the drivers on my phone? Where's the apk?

You don't. This library is **not** for installing into Android and is **not** for end users.
This library is aimed at other developers.

Each individual app must explicitly make use of libadrenotools in order to load custom drivers into an app / game.

#### How do I use this library to make \<favourite game\> use newer drivers?

See previous question. It's up to the game developer to add support & use this library.

You could contact them to so they add support for it; but that's out of our power.

just start the libary by adding a code to the application class On Created or attach contex base part
